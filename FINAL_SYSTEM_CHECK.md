## Logic Verification

### Teacher Upload Logic ✅
1. Teacher uploads file → `/teacher/upload`
2. Selects disability types (Visual, Hearing, Cognitive)
3. API processes file → `/api/teacher/upload`
4. AI generates summary
5. System finds all students with matching disability types
6. Creates StudentFiles record for each student
7. Teacher sees success message
8. Redirects to dashboard

### Student Access Logic ✅
1. Student logs in → Dashboard
2. Clicks "My Files" in navbar → `/my-files`
3. Sees personalized files uploaded by teachers
4. Files filtered by student's accessibility profile
5. Clicks file → `/file/[id]`
6. Views AI-generated summary
7. Can use Text-to-Speech
8. Content adapted to their accessibility needs

### Authentication Logic ✅
1. Unauthenticated → Redirect to `/auth/signin`
2. Sign in with Google
3. First time → `/select-role` (choose role & accessibility)
4. Returning user → `/dashboard`
5. Teacher → Teacher dashboard with upload button
6. Student → Student dashboard with My Files access

## Missing/Fixed Issues ✅

### Fixed:
1. ✅ Dashboard authentication redirect loop → Fixed with proper useEffect
2. ✅ Teacher upload page missing auth check → Added
3. ✅ My Files page missing student role check → Added
